# What is this
This is a repository where I show that I am capable of using OpenGL. It is made 
following a YouTube tutorial by the user named "The Cherno". His playlist is
located at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2

Here we use vertices to draw shapes on the screen and later on use textures instead.
You can put your own textures in res/textures and edit the source code to load it with stb_image.
We also use ImGUI in order to move textures around, for which we use matrix
transformations with glm.
